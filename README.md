#PeerCircle
PeerCircle is a consent-based social engagement coordination platform. It allows users to participate in timed "engagement sessions" where they support each other’s social media growth through manual follows and likes, ensuring a fair and transparent reciprocal environment.

 ## Overview
PeerCircle serves as:
* A coordination tool for social media engagement groups 
* A time-locked system to ensure fairness and prevent "leeching" 
* A manual verification hub for community-driven growth 
The platform prioritizes transparency, timed reveals, and organic interaction.

  ### Features
  User Experience
* Session Discovery: View active Instagram or TikTok engagement rounds. 
* Global Search: Use a unique Session ID to find specific private or public groups. 
* Timed Deadlines: Strict cut-off times for joining and submitting links. 
* Locked Reveals: Handles are hidden until the countdown hits zero to ensure everyone contributes. 
* Progress Tracking: Checklist UI to track which peers you have engaged with.  
  Admin Panel
* Session Creation: Set platform, deadline, reveal time, and Visibility (Public/Private). 
* Access Control: Set optional passwords for private circles. 
* Monitor Participation: Real-time counts of submissions and completions. 
* User Moderation: Basic tools to manage session health and user status.

 ### Core Feature: Time-Locked Reveal
The Reveal mechanic is the heart of PeerCircle. It prevents users from seeing other people's handles until they have committed their own and the deadline has passed.
User Flow
1. Find: Discover a public session on the home feed or enter a Session ID for a private one. 
2. Access: Enter a password if the session is protected. 
3. Join: Review rules and agree to participate. 
4. Submit: Provide your handle/link before the deadline. 
5. Wait: System locks all entries; no handles are visible to anyone. 
6. Reveal: At the fixed time, the list unlocks for all participants simultaneously. 
7. Engage: Users click "Open," perform the action, and return to check the box.

Session Object Example
JSON



{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "pc_7721",
      "creatorId": "user_88",
      "type": "Instagram Follow",
      "visibility": "private",
      "password": "hashed_password",
      "deadline": "2026-03-10T18:00:00",
      "revealTime": "2026-03-10T18:05:00",
      "participants": [
        { "uid": "user_1", "handle": "@creative_mind", "completed": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

  Important Safety & Fairness Notes
* No Automation: Actions are performed manually by real users. 
* Anti-Leech: You cannot see the list without submitting your own handle. 
* ID-Locked: Private sessions do not appear in public lists; they require the exact ID. 
* Format Validation: System checks for valid URL/handle structures. 
* No Privacy Risk: Only the submitted handle is shared with the specific session group. 

 ##  Development Plan (10 Days)
###Day 1 – Product Definition & UX
* Define session types (Follow/Like) and visibility logic (Public/Private). 
* Map out the "Password Gate -> Submission -> Lock -> Reveal" state machine. 
###Day 2 – Project Setup & Base Layout
* Next.js/TypeScript setup with Tailwind CSS. 
* Core layout (Navbar, Footer, Mobile-first container). 
###Day 3 – Session Listing & Search Flow
* Display active public sessions with countdowns. 
* Implement Session ID Search logic and "Join Session" rules modal. 
###Day 4 – Password Gates & Handle Submission
* Build the password entry UI for protected sessions. 
* Build submission form with input validation and state management. 
###Day 5 – Time-Locked Reveal Logic 
* Implement server-side/client-side time comparison. 
* Security logic to hide participants until revealTime is met. 
###Day 6 – Handle Cards & Engagement UI
* Create handle cards with "Open" and "Copy" functionality. 
* Optimize for external link triggers to Instagram/TikTok. 
Day 7 – Manual Confirmation & Progress
* Checkbox system for engagement tracking. 
* Dynamic progress bar (e.g., "15 / 50 Completed"). 
###Day 8 – User History & Completion
* Build the User Dashboard for history and success badges. 
* Lock sessions once a user marks all items as done. 
###Day 9 – Admin / Session Creation Suite
* Create new engagement rounds with visibility toggles (Public vs Private). 
* Set password requirements and platform reveal triggers. 
###Day 10 – Testing & Deployment
* Edge case testing (Invalid passwords, late submissions). 
* Deployment to Vercel.
